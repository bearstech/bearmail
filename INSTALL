BearMail CGI - Web interface

  These are really quick notes to install the BearMail web interface.


1. Requirements

  BearMail web frontend is based on Perl (at least 5.8) and the
  CGI::Application framework. Currently only Perl and its core modules are
  strictly required.

  You will also need a web server with the CGI feature.


2. Check out code and fetch dependencies

  $ svn co svn://forge.bearstech.com/forge/bearmail
  $ cd bearmail
  $ make cpan_update


3. Configure your web server

  You will need to map 'bearmail.cgi' to the public/bearmail.cgi URL.

  The simplest way is to use a symlink:
  $ ln -s ../bin/bearmail.cgi public/

  The other way is to use some Alias, eg. for Apache:
  Alias /bearmail.cgi /path/to/bin/bearmail.cgi


4. Browse

  Point your browser at the URL mapping the public/ folder. If you
  ran a checkout of BearMail in your ~/public_html folder, this
  would be http://localhost/~mylogin/bearmail/public
