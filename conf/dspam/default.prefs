# Default preferences for DSPAM

# This file serves two purposes. First, it sets the default preferences each
# user will see when using the preferences section of the DSPAM Control
# Center. Second, it may be symbolically linked (or copied) into DSPAM_HOME to
# set the system-wide default preferences, overriding any commandline or
# dspam.conf parameters. If symlinked, an administrator can edit these options 
# in the DSPAM Administrative Suite.
